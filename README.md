A reworked Emacs config using BetterDefaults

From Prelude I missed the confidence to understand
and alter the Emacs configuration. There were a lot
of nit-picks I had with Prelude which I grew crazy using
over time. Buggy (reverse list)  Python Intellisense,
adding apostrophe, and paranthesis, and a lot of
plain weird behaviour.

Now I am using BetterDefaults and my settings.org
file to Know my emacs-config

For reproducibility when sharing config with other
or newly-installed computers I use Cask to
automatically download all packages I use
